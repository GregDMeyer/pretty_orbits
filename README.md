Pretty Orbits
----

This Python 3 script uses SciPy+Matplotlib to generate animated plots of particles moving in free space with long-range attractive interaction.

The orbits are computed in real time as the animation plays.

The animations can also be saved to a file.

Run simply with

```python3 simulate.py```
